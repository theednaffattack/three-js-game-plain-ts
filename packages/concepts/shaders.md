# Shaders

An program which determines how your 3D object looks on the screen in regards to:

- vertex positioning
- pixel color

MeshBasicMaterial and MeshPhongMaterial are examples of shaders provided by ThreeJS.

In order for ShaderMaterial to work you must always have two shaders:

1. A vertex shader, and
2. A fragment shader
