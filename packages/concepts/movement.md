# Movement

Movement in JavaScript is applied with event listeners. We listen for an event, then react to it in some way.

It's important we use an event's "code" property when listening for events since it provides cas insensitive data. If we listen for "key," a user's keyboard may not register for the game if their caps lock is on.
